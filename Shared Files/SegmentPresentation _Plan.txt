Intro : 30sec
-- Team Name
-- Team members/positions

Risks: 2 minutes
-- 20 seconds engine is still in an awful spot
	- Nolan is partially moved to engine (rather than engine tools) after milestone
-- 30 seconds Game/Level design is not set in stone
	- la di da di da
-- 20 seconds Lua implementation is not as variadic as we would like
	- two team members instead of one
-- 20 seconds LevelEditor is not quite feature complete
	- cutting some of the safety features (like visible transform changes)
-- 30 seconds Sound design: we don't have a sound designer, so Nolan is
	- going to work on it when he has time.

Engine : 2.5 minutes
-- 10 seconds Nolan (by the way, we have sound)
	- the sound is just gonna play when the game starts, so someone needs to be ready to kill the audio.

Level Editor : 1.5 minutes
-- 30 seconds lua integration

Outro: 30 seconds
